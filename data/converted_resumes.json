The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n\u2022 WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n\u2022 The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n\u2022 Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux", {"entities": [[7880, 8486, "Skills"], [7829, 7836, "Years of Experience"], [7810, 7817, "Years of Experience"], [7795, 7802, "Years of Experience"], [7777, 7784, "Years of Experience"], [7745, 7837, "Skills"], [7731, 7735, "Graduation Year"], [7687, 7722, "College Name"], [7681, 7685, "Graduation Year"], [7664, 7680, "College Name"], [7652, 7662, "Degree"], [6598, 6611, "Companies worked at"], [5659, 5663, "Graduation Year"], [5629, 5650, "Companies worked at"], [5560, 5573, "Companies worked at"], [3651, 3672, "Companies worked at"], [3503, 3516, "Companies worked at"], [3481, 3502, "Companies worked at"], [1304, 1325, "Companies worked at"], [1288, 1301, "Designation"], [1174, 1187, "Companies worked at"], [1152, 1173, "Companies worked at"], [1136, 1149, "Designation"], [170, 177, "Years of Experience"], [102, 166, "Email Address"], [64, 71, "Location"], [42, 63, "Companies worked at"], [26, 39, "Designation"], [0, 25, "Name"]]}], ["Yathishwaran P\nMaximo Consultant - Infosys Limited\n\nNamakkal, Tamil Nadu - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Yathishwaran-P/a9c8d42210af40b8\n\n\u2022 Maximo Consultant in Infosys Limited, Chennai from August 2013 till date (around 4.8 years)\n\u2022 IT professional with 4.4 years of experience in BIRT reporting, application support in IBM MAXIMO\nApplication.\n\u2022 IBM Certified MAXIMO ASSET MANAGEMENT, PURCHASE ORDER, PROCUREMENT, PURCHASE\nREQUISITION Professional\n\u2022 Submitted Internal tutorial document on Configuration of Hover Dialogs and Its usage in Maximo\nV7.6\n\u2022 Worked on various customer requirements and having overall experience with\n\u27a2 Preventive Maintenance\n\u27a2 Maximo automation and implementation\n\u27a2 MBO customizations\n\u27a2 Data Supply chain\n\u27a2 Portals, Workflows Designing\n\u27a2 Reports/Query Creation\n\u27a2 Work order tracking, Invoicing, Purchase order\n\u27a2 Asset Management\n\u27a2 Maximo Integration Framework (MIF)\n\u27a2 Labors, Crews, Security Group Set up\n\u27a2 Domains, Database configuration\n\u27a2 Basics of BIRT, Cognos Reporting, Monitor logs from Admin console.\n\u27a2 Maximo Java customization\n\u27a2 Maximo Installation/Upgradation\n\u27a2 Basic WebSphere function\n\n\u2022 Strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work in team efficiently.

INI Parsing tool is a tool\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\n\n\n\nModule - Man Machine Language\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - Configuration Management\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static\nconfiguration data.\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - TL1\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\nback to TL1 Response messages\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

In the reversible data hiding method, First empty room\nis made by embedding LSBs of some pixels into other pixels with RDH method and\nthen encrypt the image, so the positions of these LSBs in the encrypted image can\nbe used to embed data .In the first phase, a content owner encrypts the original\nuncompressed image using an encryption key. Then, a data-hider compress the\nleast significant bits of the encrypted image using a data-hiding key to create a\nsparse space to accommodate some additional data. If the receiver has both key\ndata-hiding key and the encryption key, it can extract the secret data and recover\nthe original image.", {"entities": [[1915, 1956, "Email Address"], [950, 957, "Location"], [873, 880, "Location"], [732, 777, "College"], [720, 723, "Degree"], [632, 657, "College"], [626, 631, "Degree"], [507, 515, "Degree"], [55, 96, "Email Address"], [12, 19, "Location"], [0, 11, "Name"]]}], ["Gohil kinjal\nLooking for Android dveloper\n\nIN surendranagar - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Gohil-kinjal/f9d60e3a5b27a464\n\nIT Professional seeking a challenging and rewarding opportunity with an organization of repute\nwhich recognizes and utilizes my true potential while nurturing my analytical and technical skills\nin the field of IT.\n\nWilling to relocate: Anywhere\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n\nAndroid Application Developer\n\nFRESHERS\n\nEDUCATION\n\nMsc.it in ANDROID\n\nSauratra University -  Surendranagar, Gujarat\n\n2018\n\nBachelor of Computer Aplication in Computer Aplication\n\nSauratra University -  Surendranagar, Gujarat\n\n2016\n\nSKILLS\n\nJAVA (Less than 1 year), ANDROID (Less than 1 year), Kotlin\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical skill:\n\u2756 OPERATING SYSTEM\n\n\u27a2 Window 10\n\u2756 LANGUAGES\n\n\u27a2 Android, Kotlin, HTML, Java\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Gohil-kinjal/f9d60e3a5b27a464?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN", {"entities": [[820, 862, "Email Address"], [802, 806, "Skills"], [796, 800, "Skills"], [788, 794, "Skills"], [779, 786, "Skills"], [734, 750, "Skills"], [683, 689, "Skills"], [655, 662, "Skills"], [630, 634, "Skills"], [569, 588, "College"], [513, 567, "Degree"], [460, 479, "College"], [451, 458, "Skills"], [441, 458, "Degree"], [389, 418, "Skills"], [389, 396, "Skills"], [362, 370, "Can Relocate to"], [82, 124, "Email Address"], [25, 32, "Skills"], [0, 12, "Name"]]}], ["k.balaji krishnamoorthy\nChennai, Tamil Nadu - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/k-balaji-krishnamoorthy/\ne9b629d267dd02cd\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n\nIT\n\nhcl and tcs wipro\n\nqual for any requirement for freshers\n\nsoftware testing\n\nIT\n\nsame defined\n\nEDUCATION\n\ndipoloma ece and BE ECE\n\njaya engineering college\n\nSKILLS\n\nSoftware Testing, Sql Dba, C++, C#, Html5\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nall company equal preference job\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/k-balaji-krishnamoorthy/e9b629d267dd02cd?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/k-balaji-krishnamoorthy/e9b629d267dd02cd?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN", {"entities": [[343, 348, "Skills"], [339, 341, "Skills"], [334, 337, "Skills"], [325, 332, "Skills"], [307, 323, "Skills"], [273, 297, "College"], [248, 271, "Degree"], [143, 160, "Companies worked at"], [66, 120, "Email Address"], [0, 23, "Name"]]}], ["Kalyani Parihar\nAkola, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Kalyani-Parihar/c3a3723e8b6f12cd\n\nSeeking a challenging position in an organization which gives me a chance to improve my\nknowledge and enhance my skills and be a part of the team that excels in the work towards the\ngrowth of organization and gives me a vital experience.\n\nWilling to relocate: Anywhere\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n\nfreshers\n\nFreshers\n\nEDUCATION\n\nH.S.C.\n\nMaharashtra State Board\n\nS.S.C.\n\nMaharashtra State Board\n\nSKILLS\n\nINTERNET EXPLORER (Less than 1 year), MS OFFICE (Less than 1 year), OPTICAL (Less than 1\nyear), REFRACTOMETER (Less than 1 year), SPECTROPHOTOMETER (Less than 1 year)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nComputer Knowledge:\n\n\u2022 TOOLS - Basic Computer Application (MS office, Internet Explorer)\n\u2022 OS-Window [\u2026]\n\nInstrumental skills acquired:\n\n\u27a2 Electronic weighing balance\n\u27a2 Ph meter\n\u27a2 Muffle furnace\n\u27a2 Burst strength tester\n\u27a2 Hot air oven\n\u27a2 Optical density measurement apparatus\n\u27a2 Refractometer\n\u27a2 Thermometer\n\u27a2 Ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Kalyani-Parihar/c3a3723e8b6f12cd?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\n\n\nAcademic Project Work Completed:\n\nProject title-\"Recycling of waste\nDescription: -Recycling of waste is process of recovering chemicals as well as used for maximum\nyield of product.\nSeminar title- Construction and working of electrostatic precipitator.\nDescription - It is a dust removal device, dust present in flue gases are remove by passing\nflue gases through electrostatic precipitator.Which has highest efficiency of removing dust\nparticle.about 99% dust are removed.", {"entities": [[1045, 1090, "Email Address"], [626, 643, "Skills"], [592, 605, "Skills"], [564, 571, "Skills"], [534, 543, "Skills"], [496, 513, "Skills"], [422, 427, "Degree"], [364, 372, "Can Relocate to"], [57, 102, "Email Address"], [16, 21, "Location"], [0, 15, "Name"]]}], ["Mohd.
