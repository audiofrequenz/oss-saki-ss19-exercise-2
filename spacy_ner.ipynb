Spacy is a powerful, effective, and resource-efficient NLP library - It might surprise us with its performance on the challenge!\n",

In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\n\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

It covers the full spectra of requirements of System Services\\ndivisions.\\n• This report is site specific one and it will display the WO details along with its task WOs and\\nfailure reporting information.\\n• Each site is having their own logo. This current report will display the logo based on site.\\n• It was implemented in V7.1 only. In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page\\nnumbers (i.e., while displaying multiple WOs, for each new WO page number will not be reset\\nautomatically) . I have implemented this option in this report.\\n• Language Translation was used for this report in German and French\\n• I did not use IBM templates for this report. I have customized our own template in this report.\\n\\nBTRAMR0009.rptdesign (Availability Report):\\n\\n• This particular report relates to the requirement of the business to be able to create a\\nAvailability Graph based on selected Train Assets, a timeframe and selected work types / work\\norder parameters.\\n• Availability can be calculated based on a Fleet or a single Train.

It shows count of tickets raised and assigned to\\nboth Infosys and Client queue. We can view the total no. of tickets raised for various application\\ngroups such as Maximo, Kronos and BIEM. It also further categories the ticket count based on\\nticket priority and the status.

They also use a different work order\\nreport in Maximo V4 and V6. The earlier used report have many drawbacks such as\\n\\nNo Flexibility for modification since it is used by many divisions\\nEmpty boxes, lot of missing information\\nNot align with Systems objectives and processes\\nHistorical context on the asset is missing\\nEsthetical issues: Font too small, input fields not instinctive\\nNo bar coding used\\n• The outcome of this report is a form to support technician's work and regulation and give\\nthem simplicity to input information. It covers the full spectra of requirements of System Services\\ndivisions.\\n• This report is site specific one and it will display the WO details along with its task WOs and\\nfailure reporting information.\\n• Each site is having their own logo. This current report will display the logo based on site.\\n• It was implemented in V7.1 only. In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page\\nnumbers (i.e., while displaying multiple WOs, for each new WO page number will not be reset\\nautomatically) . I have implemented this option in this report.\\n• Language Translation was used for this report in German and French\\n• I did not use IBM templates for this report.

It is a proprietary platform and has company internal\\ncustomers. It has main two planes, system management and system service planes and several\\nsub modules.\\nI have successfully worked on the following modules.\\n\\nModule - MML INI Parser Tool\\nMML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments\\nThis Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands. INI Parsing tool is a tool\\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\\n\\n\\n\\nModule - Man Machine Language\\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server\\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\\n\\nModule - Configuration Management\\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the\\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications\\' static\\nconfiguration data.\\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\\n\\nModule - TL1\\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in\\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\\nback to TL1 Response messages\\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities.

Wireless stations are connected to form a basic\\nservice area which is controlled by a base station called Access Point. Access Point is a special\\ndevice which basically acts as a bridge between wired and wireless media connected to a\\ndistributed system generally Ethernet. Several Access Points can be connected to a distribution\\nmedia to form an extended service set.\\nIn split AP architecture AP\\'s connect to a central controller called Access Controller in short\\nAC. AP has the minimal functionalities such as receiving the 802.11 data from the radio and\\nforwarding data and management frames to AC, Power management, Advertising beacons,\\nhandling control frames. Management operations such as Association, Authentication, Handling\\nframes, conversion between […] 802.3 will be done by AC.\\nI was involved in the development of feature development, defect analysis, testing activities in\\nthe CLI, Frame handling, Association and Beacon advertisement modules.\\nModule: WLAN Support for WMM 802.11 E Qos Requirements\\nWMM is a protocol designed by the Wi-Fi forum to provide quality of service to wireless traffic.\\nThis project basically deals with providing WLAN support for WMM module, this includes handling\\nQos frames in the Uplink down link data flow, Priority mapping for Qos frames, Fragmentation\\nand Reassembly of the Qos frames, Security Related modifications for Qos Frames, Power\\nmanagement of Qos stations etc.\\nI was involved in the design, review, coding of the Uplink, Down link Data Flow, Fragmentation\\nand Reassembly of the Qos frames.\\n\\nRole: Developer\\nResponsibility: To design, and code the necessary changes.

In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\n\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.
